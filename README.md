This repository houses a Python code to evaluate the purity, completeness, and contamination of a galaxy group catalog with respect to an underlying halo distribution. This method was created by Yang et al. and is described in their 2005/2007 papers. This code is only a Python transcription of the method described in the text of these articles.
